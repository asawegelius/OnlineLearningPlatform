##3. Introduction
E-learning is a growing market. It gives an option to get an education for those that does not have access to universities and academies. The e-learning platforms today have a bias towards western languages like english, spanish, french and german. We think it is a market for other languages, like an arabic platform. 

The founder of the project left after a couple of weeks and he was the only one speaking arabic but we decided to never the less continue the work. Java uses resource bundles to make it possible to write code that is largely independent of the user's locale language. We decided to postpone the arabic translation to later and primary concentrate on building the platform. Java's support for internationalization gives you a freedom to support multiple languages with minimal work. 

The development team consists of five persons with varying knowledge/experience and that are for long time geographically disperced. The challenge have been to use PRINCE2 and Scrum as management tools to deliver a result in time.

We will first give some background information of the project and after that describe in what way we have used PRINCE2 and Scrum.

##4. Background
An online learning platform consists of many parts and we would not have time to complete everything. Our first task was to estimate how much we could complete during the time we had and how to divide the product. A learning platform have two kind of users, the content providers/teachers and the students/course participants. You need at least some kind of CMS system for the content providers and an interface the course participants can use to take the courses. It is possible to deploy courses by hand without a CMS system and the turnover is driven by the ones that takes the courses. That makes the interface to take courses the part with highest business value and our starting point. 

The next task was to decide the team structure and if we should take turns in different roles. The reason that some of us have insignificant programming skills made the optimal choise to have static roles where we divide tasks after skills. Those with insignificant programming skills should take bigger responsibilities in the management tasks and testing tasks where you are not limited by it. And those with better programming skills should take bigger responsibilities of the development tasks.
