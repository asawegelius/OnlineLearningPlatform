##3. Introduction
E-learning is a growing market. It gives an option to get an education for those that does not have access to universities and academies. The e-learning platforms today have a bias towards western languages like english, spanish, french and german. We think it is a market for other languages, like an arabic platform. 

The founder of the project left after a couple of weeks and he was the only one speaking arabic but we decided to never the less continue the work. Java uses resource bundles to make it possible to write code that is largely independent of the user's locale language. We decided to postpone the arabic translation to later and primary concentrate on building the platform. Java's support for internationalization gives you a freedom to support multiple languages with minimal work.
