### Time:
21:10-21:45
### Faciliator:
Åsa Wegelius
### Notes:
* In the PM sprints we have ahead we will implement it so we can work from distance so those not in class can participate. That is, we will have the online scrum board we decided on last meeting and the ones in class will syncronize between the Taskboard in class and the online board.
* We will not have time to implement a service relevant for this project in time for the System Integration assignment. We will therefore treat the assignment as somthing outside this group work where each one decide themselves what they want to deliver and solve the task themselves.
* The presentation in Development of Large Systems will be divided in four parts; Hadoop Common, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™), Hadoop YARN and Hadoop MapReduce. We are four that shall do the presentation so each one of us take on part.

### Notes:
Todays main subjects were the presenation on Hadoop and the Sprint review/retrospective on Friday.

The four persons involved in the Hadoop presentation are Åsa Wegelius, Tudor Stoica, Ionut Vieru, Clovis Lebret.
We decided to make a google slide on google drive where we can put together everyones slides to one slide show.
There are four modules in Hadoop so we decided to present one module each.
Tudor Stoica decided on Hadoop Common and Åsa Wegelius decided on Hadoop Distributed File System. That leaves Yarn and MapReduce for the others to choose from. We will have a meeting online in advance before the presentation. It will have to be online since Tudor Stoika comes home again on 17-04-16 and the presentation is on 18-04-16.

We have a sprint review and retrospective on Friday. We decided that Åsa can develop the user interface if Clovis uploads his work on the services on GitHub. Then we have all parts done for the sprint until then.

### Notes:
Today's main subjects were having a Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning.

####Sprint Review:
The user story was _As a Student I want to be able to browse courses , So I can find interesting courses_
We demonstrated the Client Interface and the user story was implemented in a satesfactory way. The sprint was closed down.

####Sprint Retrospective:
No one had any complains so far

####Sprint Planning:
Next user story was _As a Student I want to be able to choose a course so I can take it_. We discussed it and to be able to implement it we need to implement a user account and login functions. So we decided the story would involve enough steps to keep us busy for a sprint.

####Hadoop presentation:
We also discussed the presentation on monday and agreed that all involved should aim for 5 minutes presentation each with the exception of the first person that shall present the group. We shall have a skype meeting on Thursday or Friday to go through the presentation.
